Call the onCancel function with a function callback as its only argument to set a hook which will in turn be called when/if the promise is cancelled. onCancel returns true if the Promise was already cancelled when you called onCancel. Calling onCancel with no argument will not override a previously set cancellation hook, but it will still return true if the Promise is currently cancelled. You can set the cancellation hook at any time before resolving. When a promise is cancelled, calls to resolve or reject will be ignored, regardless of if you set a cancellation hook or not. caution If the Promise is cancelled, the executor thread is closed with coroutine.close after the cancellation hook is called.
